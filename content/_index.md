Welcome to my research notebook!

The purpose of having this notebook i have document the new findings in my research on GNN applied for traffic forecasting. A place where it can be more easy to annoted the most important information on the resaerch. As a type of diary that can easily show my current work and research development.

## Overview of the research:
The research that I'm doing concentrates on the problem of traffic forecasting. The idea is to find more better performance and optimal deep learning architectures on the problem. The motivation comes to the problem of trying to effectively predict traffic events in places that do not have much data to be train to effectively predict the traffic on the place. For that reason I'm trying to explore the concept of meta learning on these problem.

## Public vs Private Second Brain

Choose between **publishing and sharing your knowledge online or creating a private second brain**.

To create an **open second brain**, share your knowledge with others [by deploying this template](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/) as a public website.

To create a **private second brain** either:

- After deploying your site above, [password protect your online second brain](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/password-protection/) and configure your GitHub repo as **private**
- [Download this template](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-second-brain-theme) and [run the tool locally](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/)
